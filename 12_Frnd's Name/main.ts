// Q12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
//print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be
// personalized with the person’s name.




let frindsName = ["Kahkashan","Sawera","Ujala","Emaan"];

frindsName.forEach(frindName => console.log(`Hello ${frindName}, How are you?`));
